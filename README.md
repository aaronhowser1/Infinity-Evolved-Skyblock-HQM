# Infinity-Evolved-Skyblock-HQM
HQM configs that give Infinity Evolved: Skyblock a guide via HQM

Go to the Releases folder, then choose the latest version, click the "Expert Mode HQM vX.zip," and download it.

Installation instructions:

1: Either duplicate your current profile (so you don't have HQM in an existing world), or install the Infinity Evolved:Skyblock pack from Curse.

2:Click on view profile for the modpack, click on the ... in upper right hand corner, and select "Profile Options"

3: Change the name to something so you can easily tell it apart from a normal IE:S install, and uncheck the box next to "Locked". Accept the popup box that displays. Exit the profile options screen.

4: Click the button that says "Get More Content" In the search box, type "hardcore" and then install Hardcore Questing Mode. Click on "Go Back".

5: Click on the ... again and click on Open Folder. Unzip the file you downloaded from the Releases folder, and copy the "hqm" folder. Paste it into "config" folder in your profile.

6: Launch the game, start a new world with cheats enabled (in case there is an issue with the quest. Cheats will be needed to correct the problem).

7: Cancel anything you have planed for the next couple weeks.
